<h1><strong>Counter-Strike Global Offensive</strong></h1>
                            <div class="thumbnail">
                           <img src="css/assets/screenshots/csgo/screenshots/20161103174413_1.jpg" alt="Article One">
                            </div>
<h2>CSGO Review</h2>
<p>Counter-Strike Global Offensive, we look at this game today to review its features to show the audience how and why this game deserves its success.</p>
                            
<h2>Playing the game</h2>
<p>You can play CSGO online with yourself or with friends or CSGO offline with Bots, you can also play the Weapons course that is the tutorial for the game.
The weapons course is quite simple when you go through it the first time but the weapons course contains a time trail in it once you complete it so you can go back to it and compete to get a good time on the course and to train your aim. This is good because a lot of people don't know what to do and training will improve how they will play in the future.</p>
<h2>Skins</h2>
                            
<p>In CSGO you can obtain skins in the game which change the look of your weapons. You can also buy skins or gamble to obtain skins in the game market or online. This is really popular because of the art designs of weapons and some skins are really expensive, some skins cost hundreds of pounds and most of them or knifes because knife skins are really rare.</p>
<h2>Watch</h2>
<p>You can watch community games in the CSGO game as well as watch the official CSGO championships.This is good because you can learn.</p>
<h2>Awards/Statistics/Achievements</h2>
<p>You can view your own Statistics and achievements in game to see how accurate you are. This is good because looking at your own stats or achievements lets you create goals for yourself and lets you understand what you are doing bad or good.</p>
<h2>Gamemodes- Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Casual, Competitive</h2>
                            
<h2>Deathmatch</h2>
<p>In deathmatch you run around the map killing as many enemy players as you can before the time runs out, the player with the most points at the end of the match is the winner. In the gamemode you can take advantage of the bonus points it gives you if you kill with a certain gun. This game mode is both fun and good to play because it improves your accuracy and It improves your reflexes.</p>
                            
<h2>Arms race</h2>
<p>Arms race is a gamemode where you kill to upgrade your weapon and you kill with a knife to degrade your enemy's weapon. You have to upgrade in the game to the golden knife and the first person to get a kill with the golden knife wins. This gamemode practices your aim with all the weapons as well as your player placement and your ability to maintain the lead. This is good because then you will become a better player in CSGO.</p>
                            
<h2>Demolition</h2>
<p>The Demolition game mode implies the same rules as arms race but with a twist instead of you winning as a player you have to win as a team, In the gamemode you have to kill to upgrade your weapon but if you kill someone with a knife they won't degrade their weapon. There are no respawns in this gamemode until the round ends. You can win each round as a terrorist if you kill the entire opposing team or if you plant a bomb and defend it until it blows up, You can win each round as a counter-terrorist if you kill the entire opposing team or if you defuse a planted bomb. This game mode is fun and useful to play because it teaches you bomb placement and player placement which is a good thing to iron up to make you a better player.</p>

<h2>Casual</h2>
<p>In causal you play on a team and you have to win rounds to win the game. Instead of you killing to upgrade your weapon you have to buy weapons. This gamemode teaches the players to handle their money and to value their lives.</p>

<h2>Competitive</h2>
<p>In causal you play on a team and you have to win rounds to win the game. Instead of you killing to upgrade your weapon you have to buy weapons. This gamemode teaches the players to handle their money and to value their lives but in this gamemode you play with a rank and you can only play with players who are of the same skill as you. This is a good gamemode because it lets you compete competitively against same skilled players.</p>


<h2>Workshop</h2>
<p>The workshop is a community place where the community creates content for the game from skins to maps to game modes all community created content is here for you to download and use yourself or to vote upon making in the game.</p>

<h2>Skill</h2>
<p>CSGO has made weapons in their game have different spray patterns and damage output to bring more skill into a tactical based game. Learning and perfecting the spray patterns is a skill that you must learn to survive as a player in the game. This is interesting compared to all other games because it intentionally makes it harder for the player to kill and aim. The  game also has 4 types of grenades that makes the game more skillful and tactical this is because the grenade types are restricted to fire, smoke, HE and decoy.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Communication in the competitive gamemode is what makes the team more successful and is what makes the game even more tactical because the game almost needs good communication skills to win rounds and entire games, fast reflexes are not valuable unless you have information on where to place that skill.</p>

<h2>Player placement</h2>
<p>Player placement is now the tactical thinking the game has to offer and what it commands from time to time, the way you look in the game and where you place yourself in the map is mainly how you will win rounds and stay alive in the game. There are many techniques used in the game in order to place yourself correctly but only the boldest and sneakiest strategies work well the most.</p>
<h2>Bomb placement</h2>
<p>Bomb placement goes hand in hand with player placement but with a twist. There are so many ways to defend a bomb, there is using grenades, firepower, team work and there are points where you can look over the bomb as a sniper. A good bomb placement will determine what possibilities can be used to achieve a win for you and your team.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>The options allow you to customise what you like to look at when you play and adjust the game movement to your liking.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>The game offers a wide range of involvement and addiction as well as competitive playing which is why the game is so popular and addictive to play, the amount of skill and tactical thinking this game requires pretty much puts this game almost in its own genre and at the top of the FPS food chain. All the skills combined with how you play is what makes the game unique and fun and bringing in customisation of looks at the cost of money has really paid off because the players feel like they are happy with what they are paying for and for them it improves their experience.</p>

     <div class="thumbnail">
                           <img src="css/assets/screenshots/meadow/screenshots/20170122195732_1.jpg" alt="Article One">
                            </div>

<p>So we look the quite popular game Meadow and why players find this game so immersive and pleasent</p>

<p>It's not a survival game. You don't have to fight for food and water to keep your kids alive. You don't really have your family around any longer. There are no predators, no real danger. Story? Not a bit of it. End goal? Ain't gonna happen. So, what do you do in Meadow, you may wonder?</p>

<p>Well, you can walk. And walk a lot!</p>

<p>So, are you all alone in the wilderness, with nothing left to do? well thats not exactly true</p>

<p>Meadow is an online project, thus you cannot start a single player/offline mode. Not yet anyway. At least some internet connection is required. Being socially oriented, exploration still plays a significant role here. Despite the lack of usual activities, you can lose yourself in the big, open and quite beautiful world where you can find four different seasons collapses, from foggy swamps to snowy mountains, filled with chillaxing (and sometimes terrifying) ambient music and sounds. You can spend some good amount of time just wandering around, filling your eyes and soul with that beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>Only recently I have come to realize what's 'A forum in games clothing' actually means, the description line you read first on Steam page. Basically, the world of Meadow, that big floating island in the middle of nowhere - a social playground, where your main purpose is to collaborate with other people, be social and have fun. The world itself is so-called interactive 'forum' in gaming disguise, a forum without text/voice chat system, and it's actually very cool! The lack of any modern communication brings the benefits and the core immersion into the wildlife. After all, you're part of the natural habitat. You can use your body language, emoticons, self-awareness and care about other people around you. Primitive yet innovative at the same time. You won't hear shouting, swearing, chat spamming messages - you have a bunch of emoticons and your body to express yourself!</p>


<h2>No survival? No problem.</h2>

<p>So, except being super social and stuff, how do you play? You can pick from a different type of animals. Just a few from the beginning, but you can unlock more while you play. If you're a passionate collector as me, you will be pleased with the amount of things you can gather. Flowers, crystals, and of course, achievements are here to keep you productive, While unlocking animals, you can also get new skins for them or new emoticons to use, including special 3d and sound ones. There are also black obelisks you can break with the help of other players, so being in the pack may be handy, and it's more fun of course. Oh, and by collecting all the shiny things around you will receive essence, main resource of the game that will determine your place on the leaderboards, in case you want some competition.</p>


<h2>Adopted badger</h2>
<p> A funny thing I look to when I play the game is that because I chose to be a badger and I had nothing to begin with I followed other players and I followed them everywhere, I communicated mostly with a wave emoji and I pretty much became adopted into a family of one deer and 5 badgers, srurrying across the land with a family of badgers and one deer was actualy pretty fun and I have multiple screen shots of this adventure.

                            </div>
                            <p>we went all the way to the edge of the island. All in all this game is really worth it and worth it when you only communicate with emoji's and body language. I hope you enjoyed reading the review.</p>

<p>When I first played the game I played it offline and I noticed that you could pick either the story map or the randomly generated map. I chose the randomly generated map and I spawned in the middle of a desert I ran and ran a few miles in the game north and crossed a river and scavenged everything I could see from small stones to sticks and trees. I saw a few Z’s when crossing the desert but they were too far away to notice me. I ran out of water just before I crossed the bridge and I collected water under the bridge. I ran into a street with 3 buildings, A garage, a bar and a hotel which was like a skyscraper, At first I cleared out the garage by going in through the back but there was a lot of Z’s inside and out side so in the garden area I tried to kill as much Z’s that were inside as possible as the Z’s from outside broke the fence down and chased me… I ran for my life tbh and I was thankful it was still day with them all chasing me I quickly used my bow and crafted arrows using the scrap I had and killed about 9 Z’s that were  chasing me in the area. I had to break down the doors to the bar and hotel and I scavenged everything Inside them I put up some wooden spikes and in one of the rooms in the hotel I fortified the door and I placed some Tool stations a sleeping bag and A couple of chests down. The hotel structure is really strong and can take a lot of damage by the Z’s so all I had to do from there is find a water source and Build a source of food. I did both of these things by traveling to the bridge that was down the street from the hotel and on the way I collected dirt and a lot of both, I had some seeds that I found in the hotel so from there I placed all my dirt inside and cooked my water into clean water and when it become night I watched all the Z’s die to my spikes outside and the next morning I looted the Z’s and finished playing.</p> 
<p>The game is really adventurous and is good to play but the things that annoyed me in the game was how powerful the environment is and how it can kill you naturally, it is really realistic but to me personally I didn't like how hard it was for me to venture or to actually get a starting point on which to work with in terms of base building. I know that there are many more aspects to the game but because I found it so hard for me and quite bland to play alone I might go back to it to play it with friends or maybe online but now that I have little time to play games I don't want to grind the game for a long time online and then just lose it all due to an update or to other players killing me and taking my loot. I mean if I played a PVE server It would be nice but to me it's too much effort and not my type of fun.</p>

<p>Overall i would say that this game is worth it however because of how much you can edit your environment before you create the map to play on and the realistics of the game makes the game realistic.</p>
